This portfolio contains a list of projects that I have worked on as a Software Engineering student outside of my degree.

The project, Symbolic AI Chatbot, is a symbolic AI that I built purely using Python and Symbolic AI principles. It works on forward chaining and inductive reasoning, to provide the user with logical deductions and a basic chat functionality.
